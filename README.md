## Overview

Trello clone that I vibe coded in a few hours one weekend. 

This project uses NextJS 15, Material UI (MUI), and Drizzle ORM. 

It is intended for one user (admin) operation. 


## Getting Started

First, create .env file at the root (same level as next.config.ts) and populate the 3 fields below.

`DATABASE_URL` - this project uses PG and this is wher you provide the link to your DB

`ADMIN_PASSWORD` - this is a string for the admin user that will be used to authenticate requests

`JWT_SECRET` - this is used for middleware validation


Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
